    "Data Story:\n",
    "Based upon some quick data analysis and visualizations, one interesting case that stands out to me is the breakdown of how the total budget counts have changed since 2012. Seeing how the city has changed its spending behaviors and patterns, specific in which industries, helps to understand the ways in which the city is changing its focus to help improve Los Angeles as a whole. The department that consistently receives the most funding, around 220-240 expenses every year, is Transportation. While most other departments average between about 30-70, the Transportation department by far accounts for the largets portion of city expenditures over the years. This is interesting because it reveals many realities about Los Angeles as a city. LA is very much reliant upon transporation, and clearly the city expenditures reveal that the city government is fully devoted to ensuring there are practical measures being funded in order to build up city more beneficial to varying forms of transit. With programs like expanding the METRO and working to lessen the dependence on cars and other forms of unsustainable private transportation, the goverment is devoted to increasing the role of public transportation within the city of LA and the budget expenditures starting from 2012 provide more clarity to this story. Another interesting piece of data is many firms are running a defecit within the year. Calculating the difference between total budgets and total expenditures, the difference is often negative. This trend could be explained by firms focusing on improving their programs and increasing their investment in order to reap larger rewards and benefits later in the future. Firms are comfortable with creating a spending gap because programs like improving the METRO and other public policies offer the opportunity for increased rewards and benefits in the future."

    "Questions for the Data Owner:\n",
    "One question I would have for the data owner is if there is any data detailing the revenue some of these expenditures create or the broader financial impacts they have? I believe it is crucial to have the information on how the city is handling its budget and expenditures, but it is equally important to have information about what the end result of those investments are. Being able to tie both the expense and the reward together could provide a more accurate picture of why the city and the government are choosing to focus on certain departments like Transportation. Similarly, I would like to know a little bit more about where the funding is coming from. A crucial aspect of creating sustainable adn effective policy is understanding the ways in which the budget comes to be. Seeing how the govenrment creates its budget in addition to the ways in which is utilizes it can again paint a picture of how to use the data to make changes to the city. There is a lot of value in having information about all sides of the budget: where it comes from/how its financed, how the city utilizes it, and the resulting impact it has. City expenditures are crucial towards understanding how the city finances its operations and how to make the budget more efficient, but it is of an equal importance to also recognize the origins and end results of the budgets. Especially with a focus on the community, city members are the direct recipients of how the government behaves and learning how the city expenditures impacts them helps to create a broader methodology towards utilizing data to create effective policy changes.
